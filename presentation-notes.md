## HTML minification

- django-htmlmin
  - young and a bit buggy tbh
  - and only comes on when DEBUG=False - so if you get weird bugs in production ...
  - can be used outside django
- htmlmin
  - also young but looks like it's more efficient
  - not as much django integration

TODO: show django snippets

TODO: more detailed instructions?

## jquery -> jquip

- core jquip is 6.6 kB
If you do need full-fat jQuery, use a CDN, and specify the full version number
