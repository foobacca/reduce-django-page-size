# Reduce Django Page Size Talk

The core of the talk is in `pagesize-slides.md` and is intended to be processed by [mdpress](http://egonschiele.github.io/mdpress/) - so:

```
gem install mdpress
mdpress -r pagesize-slides.md
```

`mdpress -r` will complile the presentation and open it in your browser.  You can then make it full screen and press space to go through the slides.
